作業四-Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution



A mole of helium gas is confined in a metal chamber that is keep at temperature T = 400 K.

(a) Write a code that chooses random velocities satisfying the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for 10,000 helium atoms. You may calculate the velocity range from 0 to 3500 m/s and stepped (bin) by 30 m/s. The particle number in each bin is given by inputting these values to the distribution function. And then assume the velocity of the particles in this bin are randomly distribute from v to v+dv. Plot the histogram of your random speed distribution and plot the result along with the analytic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function.

(b) Compute the average, the most probable, the root-mean-square speeds from your data and compare them with theoretical value.

(c) Change the particle number to 10,000, 50,000 and  100,000 and Compute the average, the most probable, the root-mean-square speeds from your data, compare the error of these results.

(d) Plot the distribution function of helium gas in 400K, 600K and 1000K.

(e) Plot the distribution function of helium gas and N2 gas.

Hint: you can use hist in matlab to plot histogram (長條圖).
